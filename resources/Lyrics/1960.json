the West Texas town of El Paso\nI fell in love with a Mexican girl\nNighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina\nMusic would play and Faleena would whirl\n\nBlacker than night were the eyes of Faleena\nWicked and evil while casting a spell\nMy love was deep for this Mexican maiden\nI was in love, but in vain, I could tell\n\nOne night a wild young cowboy came in\nWild as the West Texas wind\nDashing and daring, a drink he was sharing\nWith wicked Faleena, the girl that I loved\n\nSo in anger I\nChallenged his right for the love of this maiden\nDown went his hand for the gun that he wore\nMy challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat\nThe handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor\n\nJust for a moment I stood there in silence\nShocked by the foul evil deed I had done\nMany thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there\nI had but one chance and that was to run\n\nOut through the back door of Rosa's I ran\nOut where the horses were tied\nI caught a good one, it looked like it could run\nUp on its back and away I did ride\n\nJust as fast as I\nCould from the West Texas town of El Paso\nOut to the badlands of New Mexico\n\nBack in El Paso my life would be worthless\nEverything's gone in life; nothing is left\nIt's been so long since I've seen the young maiden\nMy love is stronger than my fear of death\n\nI saddled up and away I did go\nRiding alone in the dark\nMaybe tomorrow a bullet may find me\nTonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart\n\nAnd at last here I\nAm on the hill overlooking El Paso\nI can see Rosa's cantina below\nMy love is strong and it pushes me onward\nDown off the hill to Felina I go\n\nOff to my right I see five mounted cowboys\nOff to my left ride a dozen or more\nShouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me\nI have to make it to Rosa's back door\n\nSomething is dreadfully wrong for I feel\nA deep burning pain in my side\nThough I am trying to stay in the saddle\nI'm getting weary, unable to ride\n\nBut my love for\nFaleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen\nThough I am weary I can't stop to rest\nI see the white puff of smoke from the rifle\nI feel the bullet go deep in my chest\n\nFrom out of nowhere Faleena has found me\nKissing my cheek as she kneels by my side\nCradled by two loving arms that I'll die for\nOne little kiss and Faleena, goodbye", "tags": ["american", "death by heart
