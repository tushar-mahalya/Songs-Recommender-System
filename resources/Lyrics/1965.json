{"lyrics": "Written by: Teddy Randazzo\n#16 Jun '65 Hot 100\n\n(CHORUS)\nTake me back, I'm begging please\nTake me back, I'm on my knees\nFor you to scold me\nHurt me, hold me\nDarling, take me back\n\nWhen you belonged to me\nI had a jealous mind\nToo late I learned that you\nWere not the cheating kind\n\n(CHORUS)\n\nMy jealous eyes have learned\nTo take a look or two\nThey were too blind to see\nThat I was losing you\n\n(CHORUS)\n\nThey say you live and learn\nAnd though I've tried before\nI promise never to\nBe jealous any more\n\n(CHORUS)", "tags": ["classic pop and rock"],
