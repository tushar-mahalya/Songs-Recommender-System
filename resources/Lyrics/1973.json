[{"lyrics": "Well, the south side of Chicago\nIs the baddest part of town\nAnd if you go down there\nYou better just beware\nOf a man name of Leroy Brown\n\nNow Leroy more than trouble\nYou see he stand about six foot four\nAll those downtown ladies call him \"Treetop Lover\"\nAll the men just call him \"Sir\"\n\nAnd he's bad, bad Leroy Brown\nThe baddest man in the whole damn town\nBadder than old King Kong\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog\n\nNow Leroy he a gambler\nAnd he like his fancy clothes\nAnd he like to wave his diamond rings\nUnder everybody's nose\n\nHe got a custom Continental\nHe got an Eldorado too\nHe got a .32 gun in his pocket for fun\nHe got a razor in his shoe\n\nAnd he's bad, bad Leroy Brown\nThe baddest man in the whole damn town\nBadder than old King Kong\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog\n\nWell Friday 'bout a week ago\nLeroy shootin' dice\nAnd at the edge of the bar\nSat a girl named Doris\nAnd oh that girl looked nice\n\nWell he cast his eyes upon her\nAnd the trouble soon began\nAnd Leroy Brown had learned a lesson\n'Bout a-messin' with the wife of a jealous man\n\nAnd he's bad, bad Leroy Brown\nThe baddest man in the whole damn town\nBadder than a-old King Kong\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog\n\nWell the two men took to fighting\nAnd when they pulled them from the floor\nLeroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle\nWith a couple of pieces gone\n\nAnd it's bad, bad Leroy Brown\nThe baddest man in the whole damn town\nBadder than old King Kong\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog\n\nAnd he's bad, bad Leroy Brown\nThe baddest man in the whole damn town\nBadder than old King Kong\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog\n\nYeah, he was badder than old King Kong\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog", "tags": ["american", "folk", "singer/songwriter"], "num_syllables":

children and another wife, \nAnd that ain't right.\nHeard them talking Papa doing some store front preachin'\nTalked about saving souls and all the time leaching\nDealing in debt, and stealing in the
