elderly\n\nRemember those who win the game\nLose the love they sought to gain\nIn debentures of quality\nAnd dubious integrity\nTheir small town eyes will gape at you\nIn dull surprise when payment due\nExceeds accounts received\nAt seventeen\n\nTo those of us who know the pain\nof valentines that never came\nAnd those whose names were never called\nWhen choosing sides for basketball\nIt was long ago and far away\nThe world was younger than today\nAnd dreams were all they gave for free\nTo ugly duckling girls like me\n\nWe all play the game and when we dare\nTo cheat ourselves at
