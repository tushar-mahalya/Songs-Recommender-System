taking me through the night\nShadow dancing, baby you do it right, uh-huh\nGive me more, drag me across the floor\nShadow dancing, all this and nothing more\n\nAll that I need is just one moment in your arms\nI was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm\nAnd I was loving you\nMake it shine, make it rain, baby I know my way\n\nI need that sweet sensation of living in your love\nI can't breath when you're away, it pulls me down\nYou are the question and the answer am I\nOnly you can see me through\nI leave it up to you\n\nDo it light, taking me through the night\nShadow dancing, baby

useless to ask me why, throw a kiss and say goodbye\nI'll make it this time\nI'm ready to cross that fine line\n\nLearn to work the saxophone\n(I) I play just what I feel\nDrink Scotch whisky all night long\nAnd die behind the wheel\nThey got a name for the winners in the world\n(I) I want a name when I lose\nThey call Alabama the Crimson Tide\nCall me Deacon Blues\n(Deacon Blues)\n\nMy back to the wall, a victim of laughing chance\nThis is, for me, the essence of true romance\nSharing the things we know and love with those of my kind\nLibations, sensations\nThat stagger the mind\n\nI crawl like a viper through these suburban streets\nMake love to these women, languid and bittersweet\nI'll rise when the sun goes down, cover every game in town\nA world of my own\nI'll make it my home sweet home\n\nLearn to work the saxophone\n(I) I play just what I feel\nDrink Scotch whisky all night long\nAnd die behind the wheel\nThey got a name for the winners in the world\n(I) I want a name when I lose\nThey call Alabama the Crimson Tide\nCall me Deacon Blues\n(Deacon Blues)\n\nThis is the night of the expanding man\nI take one last drag as I approach the stand\nI cried when I wrote this song, sue me if I play too long\nThis brother is free\nI'll be what I want to be\n\nI'll learn to work the saxophone\n(I) I play just what I feel\nDrink Scotch whisky all night long\nAnd die behind the wheel\nThey got a name for the winners in the world\n(I) I want a name when I lose\nThey call Alabama the Crimson Tide\nCall me Deacon Blues\n(Deacon Blues)", "tags": ["classic pop and
