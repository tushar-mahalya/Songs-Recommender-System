all\nWhen Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'\nHe said, \"This one's for Becky,\" as he watched the last one fall\nAnd I heard him say\n\n\"I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done\nI walk away from trouble when I can\nNow please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek\nAnd papa, I sure hope you understand\nSometimes you gotta fight when youre a

world\nComing out to dance\n\n'Cause there's music in the air\nAnd lots of lovin' everywhere\nSo give me the night, give me the night\n\nSo come on out tonight\nAnd we'll lead the others \nOn a ride through paradise\n\nAnd if you feel all right\nThen we can be lovers 'cause I see\nThat starlight look in your eyes\nDon't you know we can fly?\n\nJust give me the night\nGive me the night\n\n'Cause there's music in the air\nAnd lots of lovin' everywhere\nSo give me the night, give me the night\n\nSo come on out tonight\nAnd we'll lead the others \nOn a ride through paradise\n\nAnd if you feel all right\nThen we can be lovers 'cause I see\nThat starlight look in your eyes\nDon't you know we can fly?\n\nAnd if we stay together\nWe'll feel the rhythm of the evening\nTaking us up high\n\nNever mind the weather\nWe'll be dancing in the street\nUntil the morning light\n\n'Cause there's music in the air\nAnd lots of lovin' everywhere\nSo give me the night", "tags": ["american", "hip hop rnb
