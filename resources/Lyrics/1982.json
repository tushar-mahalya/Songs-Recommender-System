a song\nSounds like she's singing\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nOoh, baby, ooh, said ooh\n\nAnd the days go by like a strand in the wind\nIn the web that is my own, I begin again\nI said to my friend, baby, nothing else mattered\n\nHe was no more than a baby then\nWell, he seemed broken-hearted\nSomething within him\nBut the moment that I first laid\nEyes on him\nAll alone on the edge of\nSeventeen\n\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nOoh, baby, ooh, said ooh\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nSaid ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh\n\nWell, I went today, maybe I will go again tomorrow\nYeah, yeah, well, the music there\nWell, it was hauntingly familiar\nWell, I see you doing what I try to do for me\nWith the words from a poet and a voice from a choir\nAnd a melody\nAnd nothing else mattered\n\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nSaid ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nSaid ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh\n\nThe clouds never expect it when it rains\nBut the sea changes colors\nBut the sea does not change\nSo with the slow, graceful flow of age\nI went forth with an age-old desire to please\nOn the edge of seventeen\nOoh\n\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nOoh, baby, ooh, said ooh\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nOoh, baby, ooh, said ooh\n\nWell, then suddenly\nThere was no one left standing in the hall\nYeah, yeah, in a flood of tears that\nNo one really ever heard fall at all\nWell, I went searchin' for an answer\nUp the stairs and down the hall\nA-not to find an answer, just to hear the call\nOf a night bird\nSinging \"Come away\" (Come away)\n\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nOoh, baby, ooh, said ooh\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nSaid ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh\n\nWell, I hear you in the morning\nAnd I hear you at nightfall\nAnd sometime to be near you \nIs to be unable to hear you, my love\nI'm a few years older than you\n(I'm a few years older than you) My love\n\nJust like the white winged dove sings a song\nSounds like she's singing\nOoh, baby, ooh, said
