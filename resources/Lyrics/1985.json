be glad baby when you've found\nThat's the power makes the world go 'round\n\nAnd it don't take money, don't take fame\nDon't need no credit card to ride this train\nIt's strong and it's sudden, it can be cruel sometimes\nBut it might just save your life\n\nThey say that all in love is fair\nYeah, but you don't care\nBut you know what to do\nWhen it gets hold of you\nAnd with a little help from above\nYou feel the power of love\nYou feel the power of love\nCan you feel it?\n\nIt don't take money and it don't take fame\nDon't need no credit card to ride this train\nTougher than diamonds and
