concert\nShe had long hair and a short miniskirt\nI just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat\nI was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met\nI whispered in her ear, 'Come to the picture booth\nSo I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof'\nI asked her her name, she said 'blah-blah-blah'\nShe had 9/10 pants and a very big bra\nI took a couple of flicks and she was enthused\nI said, 'How do you like the show?'\nShe said, 'I was very amused'\nI started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range\nBut when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange\nThen when I asked, 'Do ya have a man?' she tried to pretend\nShe said, 'No I don't, I only have a friend'\nCome on, I'm not even goin' for it\nThis is what I'm goin' sing\n\nYou, you got what

that's a fact \nLike Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq\nForget about that, let's go into the story\nAbout a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me\nSo we started talkin', getttin' familiar\nSpendin' a lot of time so we can build up\nA relationship or some understanding\nHow it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'\nEverything sounded so dandy and sweet\nI had no idea I was in for a treat\nAfter this was established, everything was cool\nThe tour was over and she went back to school\nI called every day to see how she was doin'\nEverytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'\nI called her room, a guy picked up, and then I called again\nI said, 'Yo, who was that?'
