mighty good man\nWhat a man, what a man, what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man, what a man, what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\n\nMy man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass\nA body like Arnold with a Denzel face\nHe's smart like a doctor with a real good rep\nAnd when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep\nHe always got a gift for me everytime I see him\nA lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him\nHe never ran a corny line once to me yet\nSo I give him stuff that he'll never forget\nHe keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps\nHe's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp\nHe dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans\nHe's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams\n\nYes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not\nTryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot\nSee other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit\nBut every time they tried I said, \"That's not it\"\nBut not this man, he's got the right potion\nBaby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion\nYeah, the ritual, highway to heaven\nFrom seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven\nAnd yes, it's me that he's always choosin'\nWith him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan\nHe always has heavy conversation for the mind\nWhich means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find\n\nWhat a man, what a man, what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man, what a man, what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man, what a man, what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man, what a man, what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\n\nMy man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer\nHe's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller\nHe takes his time and does everything right\nKnocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night\nHe's a real smooth brother, never in a rush\nAnd he gives me goose pimples with every single touch\nSpends quality time with his kids when he can\nSecure in his manhood cuz he's a real man\nA lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out\nDon't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about\nEvery time I need him, he always got my back\nNever disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that\n\nWhat a man, what a man, what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man, what a man, what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man, what a man, what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man,
