But I don't know what's cookin'\n\nThey say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me\nIf they can't understand it, how can they reach me?\nI guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front\nThat's why I know my life is out of luck, fool\n\nBeen spending most our lives\nLiving in a gangsta's paradise\nKeep spending most our lives\nLiving in a gangsta's paradise\nBeen spending most

ringin' \n\nRing ding dong ring a ding ding dong \nKeep their heads ringin' \nRing ding dong ring a ding ding dong \n\nOne, two for the crew \nThree, four for the dough \nFive for the host \nSix, seven, eight for Death Row \nMad brothers bout to feel the full effect \nOf intellect, so I can collect respect \nPlus a check\nNow I'm fend to got end to my men, too \nTo take of this business I need to attend to \n'Cause my rent's due\nAnd the rap gang's my meal ticket \nSo you goddamn right, I'm a kick it \nOr get evicted\nI bring terror like Stephen King \nA black Casanova runnin' brothers over like Christine \nWhen I rock the spot \nWith the flavor I got \nI get plenty of ass, so call me an astronaut \nAs I blast pass another brother's ass who thought he was strong \nBut I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong \nWhen I flow fools, know it's time to take a hike \n'Cause I grab the mike \nAnd flip my tongue like a dike \nI got rhymes to keep you enchanted \nProduce smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted \nSo check the flavor that I'm bringin'\nThe one and only D-R-E \nAnd you know I keep their heads ringin' \n\nRing ding dong ring a ding ding dong \nKeep their heads ringin' \nRing ding dong ring a ding ding dong \n\nIf you want to get on down \nYou gotta get on down \nJust get on down \n\nDebonair with flair \nI scare wear and tear \nWithout a care \nRunnin' things, as if I was a mayor \nBut I ain't no politician \nNo competition \nSendin' all opposition \nTo see a mortician \nI'm up front, never in the back drop \nStep on stage and get faded just like a flat top \nYour rhymes sounds like you bought 'em at stop-n-go \nDre came to wax you, so just call me Mop-N-Glo \nMany try to, but just can't rock wit \nI'm six-one, two twenty-five of pure chocolate \nYour chances of jackin' me are slim, G \n'Cause I rock from summer 'til Santa comes down the chimney \nHo, ho, ho, and so as I continue to flow \n'Cause, yo, I'm just a fly Negro so \nCheck the flavor that I'm bringin'\nThe one and only D-R-E \nAnd I gots to keep their heads ringin' \n\nRing ding dong ring a ding ding dong \nKeep their heads ringin' \nRing ding dong
