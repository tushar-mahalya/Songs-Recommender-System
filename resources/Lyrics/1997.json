[{"lyrics": "Every day I wake up\nI hope I'm dreaming\nI can't believe this shit\nCan't believe you ain't here\nSometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up\nIt's hard to just keep going\nIt's like I feel empty inside without you being here\n\nI would do anything, man, to bring you back\nI'd give all this shit up, shit don't mean nothin'\nI saw your son today\nHe look just like you\nYou was the greatest\nYou'll always be the greatest\nI miss you, Big\nCan't wait till that day when I see your face again\nI can't wait till that day when I see your face again\n\nYeah, this right here goes out to\nEveryone who's lost someone that they truly loved\nCheck it out\n\nSeems like yesterday we used to rock the show\nI laced the track, you locked the flow\nSo far from hangin' on the block for dough\nNotorious they got to know that\nLife ain't always what it seem to be\nWords can't express what you mean to me\nEven though you're gone, we still a team\nThrough your family I'll fulfill your dreams\n\nIn the future can't wait to see \nIf you'll open up the gates for me\nReminisce sometime the night they took my friend\nTry to black it out, but it plays again\nWhen it's real feelings hard to conceal\nCan't imagine all the pain I feel\nGive anything to hear half your breath\nI know you still livin' your life after death\n\nEvery step I take\nEvery move I make\nEvery single day\nEvery time I pray\nI'll be missing you\n\nThinking of the day\nWhen you went away\nWhat a life to take\nWhat a bond to break\nI'll be missing you\n\nWe miss you, Big\n\nIt's kinda hard wit' you not around\nKnow you in Heaven smilin' down\nWatching us while we pray for you\nEvery day we pray for you\nTill the day we meet again\nIn my heart is where I keep you, friend\nMemories give me the strength I need to proceed\nStrength I need to believe\n\nMy thoughts, Big, I just can't define\nWish I could turn back the hands of time\nUs and the six shop for new clothes and kicks\nYou and me takin' flicks\nMakin' hits, stages they received you on\nStill can't believe you're gone\nGive anything to hear half your breath\nI know you still livin' your life after death\n\nEvery step I take\nEvery move I make (I'll miss you)\nEvery single day\nEvery time I pray\nI'll be missing you (yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\nThinking of the day\nWhen you went away (you)\nWhat a life to take\nWhat a bond to break\nI'll be missing you (somebody tell me why)\n\nOn that morning\nWhen this life is over\nI know, I'll see your face\n\nEvery night I pray\nEvery step I take\nEvery move I make\nEvery single day\nEvery night I pray\nEvery step I take\nEvery move I make\nEvery single day\nEvery night I pray\n\nEvery step I take\nEvery move I make\nEvery single day\nEvery night I pray\nEvery step I
