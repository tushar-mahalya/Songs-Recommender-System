[{"lyrics": "\u2014 Excuse me. Can I please talk to you for a minute?\n\u2014 Uh huh, sure. You know, you look kinda familiar\n\u2014 Yeah, you do too... but um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named... you know his name\n\u2014 Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name\n\u2014 I just want to let you know that he's mine\n\u2014 Heh... no no. He's mine\n\nYou need to give it up\nHad about enough\nIt's not hard to see\nThe boy is mine\n\nI think it's time we got this straight\nLet's sit and talk face to face\nThere is no way you could mistake\nHim for your man, are you insane?\n\nSee I know that you may be\nJust a bit jealous of me\nBut you're blind if you can't see\nThat his love is all in me\n\nSee I tried to hesitate\nI didn't want to say what he told me\nHe said without me he couldn't make\nIt through the day, ain't that a shame?\n\nWell, maybe you misunderstood\n'Cause I can't see how he could\nWanna change something that's so good\nAll of my love was all it took (The boy is mine)\n\nYou need to give it up\nHad about enough (enough)\nIt's not hard to see\nThe boy is mine (boy is mine)\n\nI'm sorry that you (sorry that you)\nSeem to be confused (confused)\nHe belongs to me\nThe boy is mine\n\nMust you do the things you do\nYou keep on acting like a fool\nYou need to know it's me, not you\nAnd if you didn't know it girl, it's true\n\nI think that you should realize\nTry to understand why\nHe is a part of my life\nI know it's killing you inside\n\nYou can say what you wanna say\nWhat we have that you can't take\nFrom the truth, you can't escape\nI can tell the real from the fake\n\nWhen will you get the picture?\nYou're the past and I'm the future\nAnyway, it's my time to shine\nIf you didn't know, the boy is mine (The boy is mine)\n\nYou need to give it up\nHad about enough (had about enough)\nIt's not hard to see (to see)\nThe boy is mine (that the boy is mine)\n\nI'm sorry that you (sorry that you)\nSeem to be confused (seem to be confused)\nHe belongs to me (he belongs to me)\nThe boy is mine\n\nYou can't destroy this love I've found\nYour silly games I won't allow\nThe boy is mine without a doubt\nYou might as well throw in the towel\n\nWhat makes you think that he wants you\nWhen I'm the one that brought him to\nThe special places in my heart\nHe was my lover from the start\n\nYou need to give it up\nHad about enough\nIt's not hard to see\nThe boy is mine\n\nYou need to give it up (you need to give it up)\nHad about enough (about enough)\nIt's not hard to see (it's not hard to see)\nThe boy is mine (the boy is mine)\n\nI'm sorry that you\nSeem to be confused (seem to be confused)\nHe belongs to me (he belongs to me)\nThe boy is mine (the boy is mine)\n\nYou need to give it up (not yours \u2014 but mine)\nHad about enough (not yours \u2014 but mine)\nIt's not hard to see (not yours \u2014 but mine)\nThe boy is mine\n\nI'm sorry that you\nSeem to be confused\nHe belongs to me\nThe boy is mine", "tags": ["american", "contemporary r&b", "hip hop rnb and dance hall", "pop", "r&b", "rnb"], "num_syllables": 671.4, "pos": 2, "year": 1998, "fog_index": 4.4, "flesch_index":

I could get back there\nSome place back there\nSmiling in the pictures you would take\n\nDoing crystal meth will lift you up until you break\nIt won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock\nWith a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop\nAnd then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given\nAnd I bumped again, and then I bumped again\nI said\n\nHow do I get back there\nTo the place where I fell asleep inside you?\nHow do I get myself back to the place where you said\n\nI want something else\nTo get me through this\nSemi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby\nI want something else\nI'm not listening when you say goodbye\n\nI believe in the sand beneath my toes\nThe beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling\nI believe in the faith that grows\nAnd the four right chords can make me cry\nWhen I'm with you I feel like I could die\nAnd that would be all right, all right\n\nAnd when the plane came in, she said she was crashing\nThe velvet, it rips in the city\nWe tripped on the urge to feel alive\nNow I'm struggling to survive\nThose days you were wearing that velvet dress\nYou're the priestess, I must confess\nThose little red panties they pass the test\nSlide up around the belly face down on the mattress\n\nOne, and you hold me\nAnd we are broken\nStill it's all that I want to do\nJust a little now\n\nFeel myself hovering off the ground\nI'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no\nAnd I won't run for my life\nShe's got her jaws now locked down in a smile\nBut nothing is all right, all right\n\nAnd I want something else to get me through this life, baby\nI want something else, not listening when you say\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\n\nThe sky was gold, it was rose\nI was taking sips of it through my nose\nAnd I wish I could get back there\nSome place back there\nIn the place we used to start\n\nI want something else", "tags": ["classic pop and rock"], "num_syllables": 614.7, "pos": 57, "year": 1998, "fog_index": 4.800000000000001, "flesch_index":
