settle on the breeze\nWhen I'm lying wrapped up in your arms\nThe whole world just fades away\nThe only thing I hear is the beating of your heart\n\n'Cause I can feel you breathe\nIt's washing over me\nAnd suddenly I'm melting into you\nThere's nothing left to prove\nBaby, all we need is just to be\nCaught up in the touch\nSlow and steady rush\nBaby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?\nI can feel you breathe\nJust breathe\n\nIn a way I know my heart is waking up\nAs all the walls come tumbling down\nCloser than I've ever felt before\nAnd I know, and you know\nThere's no need for words right now\n\nCause I can feel you breathe\nIt's washing over me\nAnd suddenly I'm melting into you\nThere's nothing left to prove\nBaby, all we need is just to be\nCaught up in the touch\nSlow and steady rush\nBaby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?\nI can feel you breathe\nJust breathe\n\nCaught up in the touch\nSlow and steady rush\nBaby, isn't that the way that
