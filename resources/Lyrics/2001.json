ask me to come out\nI'd say 'hey girl, come on right around'\nSo she knocked at the door, I was standing\nWith the keys in my hand to the 4x4, jumped in my ride\nChecking that nobody saw\nThe club we went in, we got down bounce, bounce to the rhythm\nSaw it was early morning, thought we'd better be leaving\nSo I gave you my jacket for you to hold\nTold you to wear it 'cause you felt cold\n\nI mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules\nI weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools\nWe were just doing things young people in love do\nParents trying to find out what we were up to\nSaying why can't you keep your promises no more?\nSaying you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4\nOut with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door\nCan you fill me in?\nWearing a jacket whose property? Said you'd been queuing for a taxi\nBut you left all your money on the TV\nCan you fill me in?\n\nAll they seem to do, is be checking up on you, baby\nWatching your every move\nThink some day they might approve? Baby\n\nWhy were you creeping 'round late last night?\nWhy did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?\nNow you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white\nCan you fill me

be alive\nI know the sun's still shinin' \nWhen I close my eyes\nThere's some hard times in the neighborhood\nBut why can't everyday be just this good\n\nIt's been 15 years since I left home\nAnd said good luck to every seed I'd sown\ngave it my best and then I left it alone\nI hope they're doin' alright\n\nNow I look in teh mirror and what do I see\nA lone wolf there starin' back at me\nLong in

moon, ah-ooh\n\nWell I might go get me a new tattoo\nOr take my old Harley for a three day cruise\nMight even grow me a Fu Man Chu\n\nAnd it's a great day to be alive\nI know the sun's still shinin'
