game so bat me down in the paint\n'Cause I can't wait no more\n'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein' me\n\nI got the Bentley valeted\nAnd I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades\nAnd I love to see that ass in Gucci shades\nHold down on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids\n\nThug style, you never thought I'd make you smile\nWhile I'm smackin' your ass and fuckin' you all wild\nBut we share somethin' so rare\nBut who cares, you care \n\nBaby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby be mine\nI'm not always

'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered\n\nTruth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair\nAnd a love with no glare is a crystal stare\nBut we share somethin' so rare\nBut who cares, you care\n\nBaby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby be mine\nI'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time\nAnd I gave you my all, now baby be mine\n\nOh I'm feelin' like ya livin' a double life\n'Cause you don't be comin' home sometimes\nBaby, but you're always, on time \nCheckin' for one time\n\nYou and I got a special bond together\nWe go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather\nAnd when I play you play the same way you freak me, baby\nI fuck you crazy, then I'm gone\n\nBaby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy\nShe'll be wakin up wet for sheezy\nRemind these bitches to mind they business\nBelieve me, this pimp game is very religious\n\nAnd I'm built like the Don Bishop\nGon' keep this
