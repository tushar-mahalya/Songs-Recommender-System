Young Buck)\nI'm lovin how you look in my eyes, swangin them hips when you pass\nI'm visualizin my name tattooed on that ass baby\nJump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley\nSip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party\nI think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble\nMaybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)\nShe got me feelin like, maybe she the wrong woman\nThink I'ma be chasin the chickenhead, you're on somethin\nYour toes painted, hair fixed all the time\nAnd your Gucci boots the same color as mine\nIf you read between the lines you can see that I want you\nI betcha I'll have you doin what you said that you won't do\nMake a decision shorty, good thangs don't last long\nYour girlfriend keeps showin me that thong\nBefore I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn\nIf you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Verse Two: Lloyd Banks)\nNow bitches be frustrated with a baller, wonder why I don't call her\nMaybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her\nIt gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her\nIn order to let her know that we friends and nuttin more\nShe loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around\nI get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound\nPictures hittin the ground, just enough to hold us down\nI'm stickin and movin, cruisin after the third round\nJust lay back baby and let me drive you crazy\nI can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady\nI admit I fell in love with her friend\nAnd to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name\nHer panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain\nI wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?\nSurroundin me, houndin me, tryin to be my ON-LY\nI'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MEY\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Verse Thre: 50 Cent)\nYeah\nDon't know what fuck me up more, watchin her lick her lips\nOr watchin her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips man\nI sweet talk her if she like\nCause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?\nLook, I'm legit now, I used to break laws\nNow you can reap the benefits of world tours\nBig house, big Benz, girl it's yours\nMink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws\nYou ain't got ta look like a model for me to adore you\nAll you gotta do is love me and be loyal\nDon't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you\nCause to me some bunny's gon' hate you that never saw you\nC'mere, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me\nPut my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me\nLet me ride on
