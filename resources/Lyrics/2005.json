sense to you right now.\nBut hey, what daddy always tell you?\nStraighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip.\nWhat you crying about?\nYou got me.\n\nHailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad\nWhen I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had\nI can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\nI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry\n\n'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers\nNo more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares\nWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it\nLaney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it\n\nWe're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news\n\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did\n\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together\nEver again like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then of course everything always happens for a reason\n\nI guess it was never meant to be \nBut it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream\n\nNow hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\n\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\nIt's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree \nAnd said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying\n\n'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\nAnd at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed\nOr shot up on the block and your mom\n\nWas saving money for you in a jar\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\n\nMom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back\nOn the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment\nAnd dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me\n\nBut daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me\nThen you started seeing daddy on the TV \nAnd mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it\nPapa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\n\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house\nJust reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\n\nWow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here\nLaney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShh, mama's only gone for the moment\n\nNow hush little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\n\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\nAnd if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'mma give you the world\nI'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\n\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'mma break that birdies' neck\nI'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)", "tags": ["8 mile", "american", "boom bap", "comedy
