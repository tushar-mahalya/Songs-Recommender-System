carrying on\n\n'Cause you had a bad day\nYou're taking one down\nYou sing a sad song \nJust to turn it around\n\nYou say you don't know\nYou tell me don't lie\nYou work on a smile \nAnd you go for a ride\n\nYou had a bad day\nThe camera don't lie\nYou're coming back down \nAnd you really don't mind\nYou had a bad day\nYou had a bad day\n\nWell, you need a blue sky holiday\nThe point is they laugh at what you say\nAnd I don't need no carrying on\n\nYou had a bad day\nYou're taking one down\nYou sing a sad song \nJust to turn it around\n\nYou say you don't know\nYou tell me don't lie\nYou work

blink\nAnd the whole thing turns out wrong\nYou might not make it back and you know\nThat you could be well all that strong\nAnd I'm not wrong, yeah\n\nSo where is the passion when you need it the most?\nOh, you and I\nYou kick up the leaves and the magic is lost\n\n'Cause you had a bad day\nYou're taking one down\nYou sing a sad song\nJust to turn it around\n\nYou say you don't know\nYou tell me don't lie\nYou work on a smile\nAnd you go for a ride\n\nYou had a bad day\nYou've seen what you like\nAnd how does it feel for one more time\nYou had a bad day\nYou had a bad day\n\n(A
