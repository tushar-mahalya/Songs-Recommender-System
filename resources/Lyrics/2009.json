of joy, and I've seen a lot of pain\nBut I don't want to write a love song for the world\nI just want to write a song about a boy and a girl\n\nJunkies on the corner, always calling my name\nAnd the kids on the corner playing ghetto games\nWhen I saw you getting down, girl, I hoped it was you\nAnd when I looked into your eyes, I knew it was true\n\nI say, hey, I be gone today\nBut I be back around the way\nSeems like everywhere I go\nThe more I see, the less I know\nBut I know one thing that I love you, baby girl\nI love you, I love you, I love you\n\nNow I'm not a highly metaphysical man\nBut I know when the stars are aligned you can\nBump into a person in the middle of the road\nLook into their eyes, and you suddenly know\n\nRocking in the dance hall, moving with you\nDancing in the night in the middle of June\nMy momma told me don't lose you\n'Cause the best luck I had was you\n\nI say, hey, I be gone today\nBut I be back around the way\nIt seems like everywhere I go\nThe more I see, the less I know\nBut I know one thing that I love you, baby girl\nI love you, I love you, I love you\n\nAnd I say, rocking in the dance, hall moving with you\nI say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you\nRocking in the dance hall, moving with you\nI say, hey, trippa, trippa, got to shoot\n\nRocking in the dance hall, moving with you\nI say, hey momma, close to you\nRocking in the dance hall, moving with you\nI say, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma\nHey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma\n\nMy momma told me don't lose you\n'Cause the best luck I had was you\nAnd I know
