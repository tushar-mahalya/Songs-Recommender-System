Diddy (hey, what up girl?)\nGrab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)\nBefore I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack\n'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back\n\nI'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes\nTryin' on all our clothes, clothes\nBoys blowing up our phones, phones\nDrop-topping, playing our favorite CDs\nPullin' up to the parties\nTrying to get a little bit tipsy\n\nDon't stop, make it pop\nDJ, blow my speakers up\nTonight, I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop, no\nOh, woah, oh, oh\nOh, woah, oh, oh\n\nDon't stop, make it pop\nDJ, blow my speakers up\nTonight, I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop, no\nOh, woah, oh, oh\nOh, woah, oh, oh\n\nAin't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer\nAin't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here\nAnd now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger\nBut we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger\n\nI'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk\nBoys trying to touch my junk, junk\nGonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk\nNow, now, we goin' till they kick us out, out\nOr the police shut us down, down\nPolice shut us down, down\nPo-po shut us\n\nDon't stop, make it pop\nDJ, blow my speakers up\nTonight, I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop, no\nOh, woah, oh, oh\nOh, woah, oh, oh\n\nDon't stop, make it pop\nDJ, blow my speakers up\nTonight, I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop, no\nOh, woah, oh, oh\nOh, woah, oh, oh\n\nDJ, you build me up\nYou break me down\nMy heart, it pounds\nYeah, you got me\n\nWith my hands up\nYou got me now\nYou got that sound\nYeah, you got me\n\nDJ, you build me up\nYou break me down\nMy heart, it pounds\nYeah, you got me\n\nWith my hands up\nPut your hands up\nPut your hands up\nNow

cares if you disagree?\nYou are not me\nWho made you king of anything?\nSo you dare tell me who to be\nWho died\nAnd made you king of anything?\n\nWho cares if you disagree\nYou are not me\nWho made you king of anything?\nSo you dare tell me who to be\nWho died\nAnd made you king of anything?\n\nLet me hold your crown, babe\nOh oh, ooh\nAh...", "tags": ["classic pop and rock"], "num_syllables":
