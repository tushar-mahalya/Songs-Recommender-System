sit-ins\nIt's human rights for everybody, there is no difference\nLive on and be yourself\n\nWhen I was in church, they taught me something else\nIf you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed\nAnd that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned\nWhen everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless\nRather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen\n\nI

your boo gone\nAnd I beat the pussy like a new song\n2 Chainz but I got me a few on\n\nEverything hot, skip lukewarm\nTell shawty to bust it open, Uncle Luke on\nGot the present for the present and a gift wrapping\nI don't feel good, but my trigger happy\nBut the stripper happy but they wish had me\n\nAnd I wish a nigga would, like a kitchen cabinet\nAnd me and you are cut from a different fabric\nI fucked her so good it's a bad habit\nBitch sit down, you got a bad atti'\nGave her the wrong number and a bad addy\nYou ain't going nowhere like a bad navi\n\nAss so big, I told her to look back at it\nLook back at it, look back at it\nThen I put a fat rabbit on the Craftmatic\nI am so high attic\nI am so high like an attic\n\nI'm different, yeah I'm different \nI'm different, yeah I'm

dollars for my sneakers\nDre told ya, a 100k for a feature\nEee-err eee-err, sound of the bed\nBeat it up, beat it up, then I get some head\n\nWell I might get some head, then I beat it up\nI don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up\nYeah it's going down, so get up\nMight valet park a Brinks truck\n\nI'm different, yeah I'm different \nI'm different, yeah I'm different \nI'm different,
