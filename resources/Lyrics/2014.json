you worry if I disappear\"\nI told her \"I'm not really looking for another mistake\"\nI called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait\nBut then I jumped right in a week later, returned\nI reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\nBut I gave her my time for two or three nights\nThen I put it on pause until the moment was right\nI went away four months until our paths crossed again\nShe told me \"I was never looking for a friend\nMaybe you could swing by my room around ten\nBaby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin\nWe'll be in between the sheets till the late AM\"\nBaby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don't wanna know that, babe\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that, babe\n\nFor a couple weeks I only wanna see her\nWe drink away the days with a takeaway pizza\nBefore a text message was the only way to reach her\nNow she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\nSinging out Aretha, all over the track like a feature\nAnd never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either\nBut me and her, we make money the same way\nFour cities, two planes, the same day\nAnd those shows have never been what it's about\nBut maybe we'll go together and just figure it out\nI'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch\nBut we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now\nWish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out\nBut she was kissing him, how? I was confused about\nShe should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don't wanna know that, babe\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that, babe\n\n*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door\nI don't even know if she knows what for\nShe was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\nI never intended to be next\nBut you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all\nAnd I never saw him as a threat\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex, of course\nIt's not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun, and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realized what you wanted\nIt's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest\nAll this time, God knows I'm singing\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so

been listenin' to the radio all night long\nSittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is\nShe was like, come here boy, I wanna dance\n'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand\nSpinnin'

dime\nIf he would have played it just one more time\nBut a little while later\nWe were sittin' in the drive in my truck\nBefore I walked her to the door\nI was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too\nBut I stopped real quick when I heard that groove\nMan, you should have seen her light up\n\nShe was like, oh my God, this is my song\nWe've been listenin' to the radio all night long\nI can't believe it came back on, but here it is\nShe was like, come here boy, I wanna dance\n'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand\nSpinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss\nAnd I said, play it again, play it again, play it again\nAnd she said, play it again, play it again, play it again\n\nThe next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars\nYou should have seen her smile when I brought out my guitar\n\nShe was like, oh my God, this is my song\nI've been listenin' to the radio all night long\nSittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is\nShe was like, come here
